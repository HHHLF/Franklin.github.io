      Unsupervised visible-infrared person re-identification (USL-VI-ReID) endeavors to retrieve pedestrian images of the same identity from different modalities without annotations. While prior work focuses on establishing cross-modality pseudolabel associations to bridge the modality-gap, they ignore maintaining the instance-level homogeneous and heterogeneous consistency between the feature space and the pseudo-label space, resulting in coarse associations. In response, we introduce
a Modality-Unified Label Transfer (MULT) module that simultaneously accounts for both homogeneous and heterogeneous fine-grained instance-level structures, yielding high-quality cross-modality label associations. It models both homogeneous and heterogeneous affinities, leveraging them to quantify the inconsistency between the pseudo-label space and the feature space, subsequently minimizing it. The proposed MULT ensures that the generated pseudo-labels maintain alignment across modalities while upholding structural consistency within intra-modality. Additionally, a straightforward plug-and-play Online Cross-memory Label Refinement (OCLR) module is proposed to further mitigate the side effects of noisy pseudo-labels while simultaneously aligning different modalities, coupled with an Alternative Modality-Invariant Representation Learning (AMIRL) framework. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art USL-VIReID methods, highlighting the superiority of our MULT in comparison to other cross-modality association methods.

      Unsupervised visible-infrared person re-identification (USL-VI-ReID) seeks to match pedestrian images of the same individual across different modalities without human annotations for model learning. Previous methods unify pseudo-labels of cross-modality images through label association algorithms and then design contrastive learning framework for global feature learning. However, these methods overlook the cross-modality variations in feature representation and pseudo-label distributions brought by fine-grained patterns. This insight results in insufficient modality-shared learning when only global features are optimized. To address this issue, we propose a Semantic-Aligned Learning with Collaborative Refinement (SALCR) framework, which builds up optimization objective for specific fine-grained patterns emphasized by each modality, thereby achieving complementary alignment between the label distributions of different modalities. Specifically, we first introduce a Dual Association with Global Learning (DAGI) module to unify the pseudo-labels of cross-modality instances in a bi-directional manner. Afterward, a Fine-Grained Semantic-Aligned Learning (FGSAL) module is carried out to explore part-level semantic-aligned patterns emphasized by each modality from cross-modality instances. Optimization objective is then formulated based on the semantic-aligned features and their corresponding label space. To alleviate the side-effects arising from noisy pseudo-labels, we propose a Global-Part Collaborative Refinement (GPCR) module to mine reliable positive sample sets for the global and part features dynamically and optimize the inter-instance relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which achieves superior performances to state-of-the-art methods.

      Unsupervised visible-infrared person re-identification (USL-VI-ReID) aims to match pedestrian images of the same identity from different modalities without annotations. Existing works mainly focus on alleviating the modality gap by aligning instance-level features of the unlabeled samples. However, the relationships between cross-modality clusters are not well explored. To this end, we propose a novel bilateral cluster matching-based learning framework to reduce the modality gap by matching cross-modality clusters. Specifically, we design a Many-to-many Bilateral Cross-Modality Cluster Matching (MBCCM) algorithm through optimizing the maximum matching problem in a bipartite graph. Then, the matched pairwise clusters utilize shared visible and infrared pseudo-labels during the model training. Under such a supervisory signal, a Modality-Specific and Modality-Agnostic (MSMA) contrastive learning framework is proposed to align features jointly at a cluster-level. Meanwhile, the cross-modality Consistency Constraint (CC) is proposed to explicitly reduce the large modality discrepancy. Extensive experiments on the public SYSU-MM01 and RegDB datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin of 8.76% mAP on average.

      Abstractâ€”Continual Learning (CL) empowers AI models to continuously learn from sequential task streams. Recently, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)-based CL methods have garnered increasing attention due to their superior performance. They typically allocate a unique sub-module for learning each task, with a task recognizer to select the appropriate submodules for testing images. However, due to the feature subspace misalignment from independently trained sub-modules, these methods tend to produce ambiguous decisions under misleading task-ids. To address this, we propose Cross-subspace Knowledge Alignment and Aggregation (CKAA), a novel framework that enhances model robustness against misleading task-ids through two key innovations: (1) Dual-level Knowledge Alignment (DKA): By aligning intra-class feature distributions across different subspaces and learning a robust global classifier through a feature simulation process, DKA enables the model to distinguish features from both correct and incorrect subspaces during training. (2) Task-Confidence-guided Mixture of Adapters (TC-MoA): A robust inference scheme that adaptively aggregates task-specific knowledge from relevant sub-modules based on task-confidence scores, avoiding overconfidence in misleading task-id predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CKAA outperforms existing PEFT-based CL methods.

      Abstractâ€”Continual learning (CL) aims to equip models with the ability to learn from a stream of tasks without forgetting previous knowledge. With the progress of vision-language models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), their promise for CL has attracted increasing attention due to their strong generalizability. However, the potential of rich textual semantic priors in CLIP in addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma remains underexplored. During backbone training, most approaches transfer past knowledge without considering semantic relevance, leading to interference from unrelated tasks that disrupt the balance between stability and plasticity. Besides, while text-based classifiers provide strong generalization, they suffer from limited plasticity due to the inherent modality gap in CLIP. Visual classifiers help bridge this gap, but their prototypes lack rich and precise semantics. To address these challenges, we propose Semantic-Enriched Continual Adaptation (SECA), a unified framework that harnesses the anti-forgetting and structured nature of textual priors to guide semantic-aware knowledge transfer in the backbone and reinforce the semantic structure of the visual classifier. Specifically, a Semantic-Guided Adaptive Knowledge Transfer (SG-AKT) module is proposed to assess new images' relevance to diverse historical visual knowledge via textual cues, and aggregate relevant knowledge in an instance-adaptive manner as distillation signals. Moreover, a Semantic-Enhanced Visual Prototype Refinement (SE-VPR) module is introduced to refine visual prototypes using inter-class semantic relations captured in class-wise textual embeddings. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach.
